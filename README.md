PDF to Word Converter and Translator
This Python project allows you to convert PDF files to Word documents and translate their contents to French.

Prerequisites
To use this project, you must have Python and pip, the Python package manager, installed on your computer. If you don't have pip, you can install it by running the following command in a command prompt:


python -m ensurepip --default-pip

This project also uses the following Python libraries:

PyPDF2 to read and extract text from PDF files
docx to create Word documents
googletrans to translate text
tkinter to create a graphical user interface
You can install these libraries by running the following command in a command prompt:


pip install pypdf2 docx googletrans tkinter

Note: If you are using Python 3.9, you will need to use pip3 instead of pip.

Usage
To use this project, run the convert.py script using Python. A window will open with a text field and two buttons. Click "Select a file" to select a PDF file to convert. Once you have selected a file, its name will be displayed in the text field. Click "Convert to Word" to start the conversion. The PDF file will be converted to a Word document and translated to French, then saved as "mon_document.docx".
